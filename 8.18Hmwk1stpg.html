            <strong>Shanika Marlow, what a name ugh!</strong> Well to tell you the truth my name is probably the most interesting thing about me. I consider
            myself to be very clumpsy but kinda funny from time to time, depending on how tought the crowd of course. My
            hopes are that I can use my unique skills and ability to problem solve through coding and development. I have
            always cosidering myself a problemsolver of some sort, Jill (whos Jack?) of all trades and maste rof none. Some
            call me Queen B. but if you ask me there is only enough room in this world for one Queen B. and thats <a href="https://www.beyonce.com/" target="_blank">BEYONCE</a> 
            of course!

            <p class="paras">
                So far this class/session has been a hell of a ride. I believe the base knowlede I just might have down but they styling is
                a whole different story. From time to time I still find myself doubting my actions from begining to end untill
                i start typing of cousre. Also using google and other online resouseces as a direct tool for assistance ahs
                been very helpful. The internet I consider to be us as developers open book tool to coding in various langues.
